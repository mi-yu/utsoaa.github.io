		h2 About Us
		p The Central Texas Outreach for Science Extracurriculars is an organization of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty members at the University of Texas at Austin, dedicated to spreading Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education throughout middle and high schools in Central Texas through Science Olympiad, a nationally recognized academic competition. The organizationâ€™s goals are to foster enthusiasm and interest in STEM, as well as promoting teamwork, sportsmanship, and the spirit of competition, by establishing new Science Olympiad teams in schools where such extracurriculars are not currently present, mentoring students in STEM subjects outside of the classroom curriculum, and providing opportunities for competition.
